1601540289 arneshie#2102 Hello tribber
1601540291 arneshie#2102 <@!110286470803140608>
1601540295 Squeeble#6042 naturally yknow i stick around her a lot
1601540297 adore#1725 WAIT I FORGOT
1601540298 Meeks#4309 hay
1601540298 Squeeble#6042 and try to talk to her
1601540300 adore#1725 About the dain thing
1601540305 Squeeble#6042 and i just feel like this
1601540306 sean#9644 dude adore
1601540312 Squeeble#6042 very judgmental vibe
1601540312 sean#9644 u straight up grief his twitter priv
1601540313 Squeeble#6042 the entire time
1601540317 sean#9644 he thinks it's a joke but it's serious
1601540319 Meeks#4309 https://i.imgur.com/pg4rO95.png
1601540323 Squeeble#6042 and so comes when we start doing like edibles and stuff
1601540327 Squeeble#6042 i get super paranoid
1601540331 Squeeble#6042 because i have a lot running through my mind
1601540335 Squeeble#6042 and im freaking tf out really badly
1601540345 Squeeble#6042 and they separate me and her from diff rooms
1601540352 Squeeble#6042 and i knew something was up cause like its p obvious why
1601540357 Squeeble#6042 and i was freaking out super badly
1601540365 Squeeble#6042 but all 3 of them were comforting her the whole time
1601540373 Squeeble#6042 and i was just left alone in the room freaking out
1601540388 Squeeble#6042 i think jintae would check on me for like 10 secs then go back
1601540393 Squeeble#6042 to the room drina was in
1601540408 Squeeble#6042 and i remember when we were all in the living room
1601540419 Squeeble#6042 they would get up to go somewhere and drina was like can i come too
1601540425 Squeeble#6042 and i was thinking oh they are probably talking about me
1601540430 Squeeble#6042 only to find out later that they actually were
1601540445 Squeeble#6042 so basically the entire trip they knew she didnt like me when i was there having no idea
1601540466 Squeeble#6042 so all the time i was walking next to her or talking to her etc it probably looked super awkward and bad
1601540470 Squeeble#6042 and just made me feel really stupid
1601540481 Squeeble#6042 and then we do edibles again another night
1601540487 Squeeble#6042 and the same thing happens again
1601540497 Squeeble#6042 i go into paranoid state because i feel like things are happening behind my back
1601540510 arneshie#2102 Its not paranoia if its true imo but continue
1601540510 Squeeble#6042 and we are separated into different rooms
1601540519 Squeeble#6042 and they are comforting her again the whole time
1601540525 Squeeble#6042 the only person that talked to me was chris
1601540528 Squeeble#6042 cause i called him on discord
1601540552 Squeeble#6042 and eventually kitts comes in and i just felt super awful and just told him what was wrong
1601540561 Squeeble#6042 and he said drina didnt like me etc etc
1601540573 Squeeble#6042 and so come next morning i felt like utter dog shit
1601540577 Squeeble#6042 and just overall super stupid
1601540586 Squeeble#6042 and that was the day our flight was
1601540615 Squeeble#6042 and when i booked flights me and her were together so they were booked later so we can have more time together
1601540620 Squeeble#6042 and then comes when we are actually alone
1601540629 Squeeble#6042 (((((BTW I AM LONG OVER DRINA)))))))
1601540642 Squeeble#6042 its just me and her and i basically ask like what happened etc etc
1601540646 Squeeble#6042 and she didnt say a word
1601540650 Squeeble#6042 like i spilled my heart out
1601540659 Squeeble#6042 and nothing came out of it
1601540674 Squeeble#6042 so flash forward to like
1601540677 Squeeble#6042 me getting home and stuff
1601540681 Squeeble#6042 i just felt like shit
1601540690 Squeeble#6042 and so i thought ok ill hang w/ my friends (kitt server)
1601540697 Squeeble#6042 only to find out that drina was in there perma
1601540706 Squeeble#6042 and i really had no opportunity to hang out with them
1601540715 Squeeble#6042 even though i was the one that encouraged her to start joining more
1601540728 Squeeble#6042 and none of them bothered to message me for a good bit of days
1601540751 Squeeble#6042 so i basically had to force myself to go in there cause i felt like i didnt have anyone else to talk to
1601540767 Squeeble#6042 and found out that tim thought i was really cringe or just stuff was being said about me
1601540772 Squeeble#6042 cause sean asked nomsen about it
1601540785 Squeeble#6042 ok so flash forward like
1601540787 Squeeble#6042 6 months later
1601540790 Squeeble#6042 im out of server etc
1601540796 Squeeble#6042 jintae messages me and we just talking
1601540803 Squeeble#6042 and he brings up the trip
1601540814 Squeeble#6042 and he tells me something and hes like "WAIT I CANT LEAK THAT..."
1601540816 Squeeble#6042 and does it anyways
1601540821 Squeeble#6042 and tells me that on one of the nights
1601540833 Squeeble#6042 that i was having a mental breakdown in one of the rooms alone
1601540848 Squeeble#6042 drina and tim were cuddling in bed and she asked him if they could date again
1601540861 Squeeble#6042 legit like 2 rooms down from me having a breakdown LOLOL
1601540868 Squeeble#6042 and when everyone knew well what was going on
1601540875 Squeeble#6042 the entire trip i was the only one that had no idea what was going on
1601540888 Squeeble#6042 so the feeling of betrayal and just all of that rly fucked me over
1601540894 Squeeble#6042 from all of them
1601540910 Squeeble#6042 thats basically the sum of it its easier talking about more details in call

1601542349 faur#6473 LOL
1601542350 faur#6473 LOL
1601542361 Axarious#6947 LOL
1601542478 Axarious#6947 <@!92967072513925120> so what is that
1601542481 Axarious#6947 glp > ludens?
1601542486 faur#6473 yea
1601542490 faur#6473 idk if u were in call
1601542492 Axarious#6947 sample size is small
1601542495 faur#6473 but moses asked what to build on ziggs
1601542497 Axarious#6947 you can't say that for sure
1601542497 faur#6473 i said glp
1601542500 faur#6473 meeks said ludens
1601542510 faur#6473 i said glp is almost always better than ludens
1601542512 Axarious#6947 yea maybe if you're really good at ziggs you'd pick glp
1601542523 Axarious#6947 na that's incorrect statistically
1601542529 faur#6473 well
1601542530 faur#6473 i said that
1601542537 faur#6473 without those stats
1601542540 faur#6473 just as an item
1601542546 faur#6473 glp is almost always better than ludens on mid mages
1601542551 faur#6473 but then i looked up the stats today
1601542552 Axarious#6947 51% across 38k is still probably better than 60% over 100 games
1601542578 faur#6473 yeah but ludens is in the recommended tab so
1601542584 faur#6473 it will almost always be bought over glp
1601542588 faur#6473 bceause the sheep dont know
1601542590 faur#6473 that glp is better
1601542595 faur#6473 i agree the sample size is really small
1601542600 faur#6473 so its harder to say
1601542612 faur#6473 but i was just curious on the w/r stat
1601542616 faur#6473 since i knew glp was better
1601542619 faur#6473 so i checked
1601542621 Axarious#6947 i'm saying
1601542624 Axarious#6947 even with the stats
1601542629 Axarious#6947 ludens is better
1601542646 Axarious#6947 not disagreeing w/ anything, just statistically
1601542663 Axarious#6947 binom dist would likely make ludens > glp
1601542680 faur#6473 what is binom dist
1601542683 faur#6473 LOL?
1601542684 Axarious#6947 binomial distribution
1601542687 faur#6473 ah
1601542694 Axarious#6947 like, on pure statistical analysis
1601542697 faur#6473 yea
1601542703 faur#6473 but also i guarentee
1601542706 faur#6473 if a pro player
1601542709 faur#6473 picked ziggs and build glp
1601542714 faur#6473 the pick rate of that item
1601542716 faur#6473 would sky rocket
1601542724 Axarious#6947 sure
1601542724 faur#6473 its just cause people dont actually know glp is better than ludens
1601542765 faur#6473 that makes sense tho that bceause of the pick rate ludens would be bebtter
1601542834 faur#6473 im actually curious of that now
1601542842 faur#6473 ill check like syndra items
1601542884 faur#6473 https://puu.sh/Gyh7O/68fe8b431d.png
1601542887 faur#6473 damn
1601542903 Axarious#6947 yea that one is a surefire glp > ludens
1601542914 Axarious#6947 well hmm maybe not
1601542936 Axarious#6947 like error bar for ludens is smaller
1601542953 faur#6473 so what would u say is the cutoff on pickrate to make it a better statistical purchase regardless of the items strengths
1601542956 faur#6473 like 10%?
1601542969 faur#6473 just curious for statistic wise
1601542987 Axarious#6947 well it's more like deviation
1601542999 Axarious#6947 let's say your probability of winning is between 48 and 49% if you pick ludens
1601543004 Axarious#6947 given you have 6k game samples
1601543015 Axarious#6947 but your probability is between 45 and 55 for glp
1601543024 Axarious#6947 larger margin just because less people have played it
1601543033 Axarious#6947 so there's overlap, but it really depends
1601543046 faur#6473 then it just goes down to skilgap
1601543048 Axarious#6947 if there's less games, the error would point to being more of a "coinflip" item
1601543050 Axarious#6947 yeah exactly
1601543054 Squeeble#6042 
1601543055 Squeeble#6042 going nuclear in the editor
1601543056 Axarious#6947 really depends on how you pilot the champion
1601543056 faur#6473 icic
1601543061 faur#6473 just a pilot gap
1601543066 Axarious#6947 esp on the ziggs
1601543071 Axarious#6947 only 170 people have played it in the games
1601543073 Axarious#6947 or smth
1601543080 faur#6473 yeha that was d2+
1601543081 Axarious#6947 so those are probably high rated otps
1601543085 faur#6473 i wanted to check the higher elo stats
1601543089 faur#6473 the 1st pick was plat+
1601543092 faur#6473 2nd was d2+
1601543094 Axarious#6947 yea
1601543110 Axarious#6947 even then, ludens is probably ok
1601543114 Axarious#6947 51% on way more games
1601543117 Axarious#6947 just consistency
1601543128 faur#6473 yea ia gree ludens still has its upsides
1601543140 faur#6473 and theres reasons you wouldnt buy glp
1601543144 faur#6473 in certain games
1601543145 Axarious#6947 plus like if you playing against shitters they can't sidestep the bomb anyways (me)
1601543155 faur#6473 LOL
1601543168 Axarious#6947 little known fact
1601543179 Axarious#6947 ziggs bomb attracts plat and below players
