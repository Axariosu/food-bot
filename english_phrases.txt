a cairn of stones
a child of nature
a clash of titans
a crash of rhinos
a crowd of people
a drove of cattle
a force of nature
a fount of wisdom
a freak of nature
a lapse of memory
a piece of string
a point of honour
a round of drinks
a sense of humour
a sense of regret
a sense of relief
a sense of rhythm
a sheaf of papers
a siege of herons
a taste of Spring
a taste of summer
a thing of beauty
a touch of genius
a union of states
a voice of reason
a waste of breath
a waste of energy
I didnt say a word
a close run thing
a whole new world
O Brave New World
T shirt and jeans
a dream come true
a stiff upper lip
a final farewell
a fools paradise
a great distance
a happy accident
a hasty decision
a known quantity
a lofty ambition
a major drawback
a mixed blessing
a nasty surprise
a paper exercise
a right shambles
a risky business
a tight deadline
a tight schedule
a total stranger

a strong stomach
a thorny problem
a touchy subject
a wasted journey
I Married a Witch
O tempora O mores
a baptism of fire
a climate of fear
a flicker of life
a glimmer of hope
A Handful of Dust
a licence to kill
a modicum of luck
a quarter to five
a quarter to four
a quarter to nine
I thought as much
a hundred and one
a hundred not out
a starter for ten
a blessed relief
a certain person
a cursory glance
a cutting remark
a distant memory
a glowing report
a keynote speech
a kindred spirit
a million pounds
a passing shower
a pointed remark
a problem halved
a problem shared
a serious matter
a sitting target
a slender chance
a telling remark
a valiant effort
a vicious rumour
a welcome change
a willing helper
a willing victim
a casualty of war
a thousand to one
a blinding flash
a blinding light
a definite maybe
a familiar theme
a hopeless cause
a laughing stock
a misspent youth
a niggling doubt
a physical wreck
a piercing stare

A Temporary Life
a thankless task

A Shropshire Lad
or I am a dutchman
in a bit of a hurry
if I may be so bold
do a lap of honour
do a lot of damage
in a fit of temper
do a job properly
at a rate of knots
in a pool of blood
by a long stretch
In a Bath Teashop
on a firm footing
on a full stomach
be a waste of time
by a quirk of fate
by a trick of fate
by a twist of fate
do a world of good
in a state of flux
by a split second
in a split second
in a tight corner
on a crash course
on a fools errand
on a tight budget
to a great extent
to a large extent
in a minute or two
in a moment or two
in a little while
in a public place
on a bigger scale
on a higher plane
on a larger scale
on a weekly basis
on a yearly basis
as a general rule
in a similar vein
on a happier note
on a lighter note
as a consequence
in a predicament
go to a good cause
on to a good thing
go on a walkabout
As it is in Heaven
be in at the death
be in no fit state
go up in the world
on an ad hoc basis
go so far as to say
be on the qui vive
go in for the kill

do it the hard way
go in the back way
in at the deep end
be at the mercy of
be in the habit of
be in the running
be of the opinion
be on the lookout
go by the wayside
go on the rampage
go on the streets
go on the warpath
go to any lengths
go to the barbers
go to the country
go to the doctors
go to the theatre
go to the trouble
be in with a shout
up to ones ears in
up to ones eyes in
up to ones neck in
at it like knives
be in ones dotage
be on safe ground
go on ones rounds
to no good effect
up to ones elbows
up to your elbows
as an added bonus
be at great pains
by no means least
go to great pains
in an ideal world
in no great hurry
of no fixed abode
OK in small doses
be in league with
go on bended knee
hi yo silver away

of no earthly use
be of assistance
do it yourselfer
go to confession
of no importance
Oh my Godfathers
go for a bike ride
to see a fine lady
in for a surprise
as far as I can see
as fat as a porker
as fit as a fiddle
as mad as a hatter
as far as is known
an ace in the hole
go out on the town
go toe to toe with
on top of the heap
on top of the hill
on top of the pile
go out of ones way
go out of your way
no leg to stand on
be led to believe
by way of apology
et ego in Arcadia
go out of control
go out of fashion
in aid of charity
in awe of someone
no end of trouble
to put it bluntly
to put it crudely
Un Bel di Vedremo
as the day is long
at the end of time
to the end of time
an out and out lie
be all and end all
an eye for detail
go for the throat
go off the handle
in the hit parade
in the top flight
of its own accord
of the old school
on its own merits
on the off chance
to the nth degree
We are not amused
go off with a bang
go out like a lamb
go out with a bang
in the land of nod
in the name of god
We Are What We Are
We can work it out
as the case may be
in the mood for it
as the crow flies
at one fell swoop
at the last count
at the very least
be off ones guard
be one step ahead
be the bees knees
by the same token
do the same again
Ho Chi Minh Trail
in all ones glory
in one fell swoop
in the best sense
in the next world
in the past tense
in the real world
in the same class
on the band wagon
on the home front
on the late shift
on the same level
on the shop floor
on the spot fines
to the back teeth
to the four winds
to the last ditch
by the looks of it
by the sound of it
in the thick of it
it was meant to be
as the story goes
at any given time
at the going rate
At the Hawks Well
at the right time
at the wrong time
by the truck load
by the wagon load
do the dirty work
et hoc genus omne
go the extra mile
Im all right Jack
in the first wave
in the front line
in the front rank
in the inner city
in the olden days
in the short term
in the wrong gear
of the first rank
on the blind side
on the dusty road
on the fault line
on the front foot
on the front line
on the front page
on the heavy side
on the other foot
on the other hand
on the other side
on the right side
on the right tack
on the scrap heap
on the shady side
on the short list
on the short side
on the sunny side
on the windy side
on the wrong foot
on the wrong side
on the wrong tack
so the story goes
at the bitter end
do the school run
in the family way
in the market for
in the modern era
in the public eye
to the bitter end
to the casual eye

do the spadework
in all innocence
in bad condition
in the aftermath
in the afternoon
in the ascendant
in the beginning
in the clubhouse
in the forefront

on the bandwagon
on the breadline

on the outskirts
on the periphery

on the shortlist
on the sidelines
on the threshold

as daft as a brush
as hard as a stone
as pale as a ghost
it must be a first
as good as it gets
in next to no time
it gets on my wick

do ones own thing
do your own thing
go down the chute
go down the drain
go down the tubes
Go like hot cakes
go with the grain
in ones own hands
in ones own right
in ones own words
in very bad taste
in your own right
in your own words
it does the trick
it pays the bills
no room for doubt
no room for error
on ones own terms
so much the worse

We live and learn
on your head be it
at ones last gasp
Be like that then
be numb with cold
do what ones told
go over ones head

in over ones head
in over your head
It cuts both ways
on ones beam ends
on ones last legs
on your last legs
go west young man
in ones minds eye
in your minds eye

I get a kick out of you
I Was a Male War Bride
I Say a Little Prayer
a bit of an eye opener
a bit on the damp side
a fly in the ointment
a rap on the knuckles
a bit of light relief
a cat in hells chance
a one in eight chance
a one in three chance
a bit of harmless fun
a man of consequence
a new kid on the block
A Man for All Seasons
a bit too early to say
a bit late in the game
a bit past ones prime
a bit pushed for time
a bit disappointing
a bull in a china shop
a turn up for the book
a load of old rubbish
a walk in the country
a card up ones sleeve
a card up your sleeve
a frog in ones throat
a nail in ones coffin
I come to bury Caesar
a bout of depression
a gang of cutthroats
a lack of commitment
a load of codswallop
a pack of cigarettes
a term of endearment
A Good day to Die Hard
a good eye for detail
I cant say that I have
a cock and bull story
a hawk from a handsaw
I dont give a monkeys
a hard road to travel
a nice turn of phrase
I know that for a fact
a pact with the devil
a plea from the heart
I dont give two hoots
I dont make the rules
I wont tell you again
a roof over ones head
a tall dark stranger
a week last Saturday
a week last Thursday
I Know Where Im Going
a fuss about nothing
a last ditch attempt
a well oiled machine
a fine figure of a man
a fine kettle of fish
a shot across the bow
a five minute wonder
a nail biting finish
a nice little earner
I come bearing gifts
a fine dividing line
a thin dividing line
a well balanced diet
a break in the clouds
a chink in the armour
A Death in the Family
a fight to the finish
a niche in the market
a piece of the action
a shock to the system
a slice of the action
a spoon of castor oil
a blaze of publicity
a brood of pheasants
a drain on resources
a faith of merchants
a flash of lightning
a fount of knowledge
a frame of reference
a point of principle
a sense of adventure
a sense of belonging
a smack of jellyfish
a spate of robberies
a sprig of mistletoe
a stalk of foresters
a state of emergency
a troop of kangaroos
a waste of resources
A Woman of Substance
a tough act to follow
a feast fit for a king
a sight for sore eyes
a whole new ball game
a fight for survival
a hoary old chestnut
a whole new ballgame
a young slip of a girl
a clean pair of heels
a steep hill to climb
I Sacri Nomi di Padre
a blast from the past
a funny five minutes
a quick whiz through
a nasty piece of work
a price worth paying
I could murder a pint
I never forget a face
a happy coincidence
a major undertaking
a solid performance
a vague possibility
a vivid imagination
a chance in a hundred
a chance in a million
a finger on the pulse
a killer on the loose
a knight of the realm
a martyr to the cause
a handle to ones name
a monkey on ones back
a spring in ones step
a stroke of good luck
a breath of fresh air
a finger in every pie
a change of clothing
a change of emphasis
a change of fortunes
a damsel in distress
a flight of swallows
a flurry of activity
a hotbed of intrigue
a huddle of penguins
A Legend of Montrose
a master of disguise
a matter of interest
a matter of judgment
a muster of peacocks
a packet of biscuits
a string of offences
a troupe of acrobats
a sprint for the line
a matter for concern
a memory like a sieve
a little bird told me
a lesson well learnt
a double edged sword
a bitter experience
a heated discussion
a pained expression
a prized possession
a shrewd investment
a smooth transition
a message in a bottle
a tempest in a teapot
a parting of the ways
a feather in ones cap
a feather in your cap
a canteen of cutlery
a diamond is forever
A Fistful of Dollars
a hostage to fortune
a mockery of justice
A Scandal in Bohemia
I venture to suggest
O Captain My Captain
I couldnt give a toss
I wouldnt have a clue
I wouldnt count on it
I wouldnt dream of it
a million miles away
I couldnt agree more
a calming influence
a gnawing suspicion
a hostile reception
a radical departure
a rousing reception
a rousing rendition
a serious contender
a fraction of an inch
a question of timing
a rattling good yarn
a cavalier attitude
a complete shambles
a complete stranger
a hardened criminal
a national treasure
a pleasant surprise
a salutary reminder
a slippery customer
A Somerset Rhapsody
a straight question
a hastiness of cooks
a concerned citizen
a deafening silence
a landslide victory
a temporary measure
a temporary setback
a parliament of owls
a shrewdness of apes
a monumental cock up
a convenient excuse
a cumulative effect
a glittering career
a suspicious nature
a terrifying ordeal
a bewildering array
a godforsaken place
a breathtaking view
a pathological liar
a preconceived idea
if I was in your shoes
If I Were a Carpenter
on a wing and a prayer
as I live and breathe
in a rich vein of form
on a wild goose chase
be a good investment
be a thing of the past
in a class of ones own
in a class of your own
in a world of ones own
in a world of your own
in a class by oneself
In a month of Sundays
in a state of decline
in a state of undress
at a knock down price
in a league of her own
in a league of his own
in a league of its own
as a matter of course
in a frenzy of desire
in a foetal position
in a sealed envelope
in a tricky position
on a mission of mercy
be a shining example
on a routine mission
in a paroxysm of rage
at a knockdown price
in a different class
in a different light
on a different plane
on a temporary basis
on a voluntary basis
at a blistering pace
on a starvation diet
be at a disadvantage
to be on the safe side
be at it like rabbits
be of no consequence
as we say in the trade
to my way of thinking
Id be the last to know
be on the right lines
be on the losing side
go to the mattresses
be on ones high horse
be on ones Jack Jones
go in with both fists
go to meet ones maker
go to meet your maker
go on hands and knees
be at cross purposes
by no manner of means
on an errand of mercy
in my humble opinion
be in seventh heaven
in an orderly manner
be an acquired taste
be at someones mercy
in an enclosed space
of no monetary value
as an alternative to
as an approximation
in no circumstances
we are a grandmother
as mad as a march hare
as far as one can tell
be out of the running
My way or the highway
an ace up ones sleeve
be out of ones crease
be out of ones league
no way to treat a lady
to put it another way
an air of excitement
as old as Methusaleh
at the end of the road
at the top of the heap

We Are The Champions
Do you have a problem
My old mans a dustman
in too much of a hurry
at the back of my mind
in the back of my mind
in the palm of my hand
in the back of the net

if you catch my drift
on the verge of tears
be the worse for wear
at the first attempt
at the third attempt
in the final moments
on the medal rostrum
at the barrel of a gun
by the hammer of Thor
do two things at once
in the course of time
in two places at once
on the stroke of noon
in the public domain
on the public record
at the halfway point
if the weather holds
in the outside world
in the popular press

of ones own free will
of your own free will
up hill and down dale

go ones own sweet way
in your own sweet way
by ones own volition
go down the plughole
go like the clappers
in ones own interest
in your own interest
it begs the question
of ones own volition
of your own volition
if push came to shove
at ones beck and call
at your beck and call
no more boom and bust
in more ways than one

as tough as old boots
